### Installation Guide
Make sure you have configured the React Native development environment on your computer.

First of all run ```yarn install``` to install the dependencies

Then run ```npx expo run:ios``` to install the project on either your iOS simulator or your connected iPhone device.

The project is made with Expo and uses a custom dev client so it won't work with the traditional Expo Go App. You'll need to compile your client by running the above command ```npx expo run:ios```.

Thanks
