###Installation Guide
Make sure you have configured react native development environmet on your computer.

First of all run `yarn install` to install the dependencies

Then run `npx expo run:ios` to install the project on either your iOS simulator or your connected iPhone device.

The project is made with expo and uses custom dev client so it won't work with the traditional Expo Go App. You'll need to compile your own client by running the above command `npx expo run:ios`.

Thanks
